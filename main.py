# QUESTIONS -- DO THESE LAST.
# Assumptions: assume the letter grid has width W and height H
# Further assume the word parameter has length L (for find) and than the max_len parameter is L (for extract)
# Finally, Assume that concatenating a letter to a string takes time O(1)
# List any other assumptions you make.

# For each question below, answer your questions by filling in the provided multi-line strings.
# (yes it's a bit of a hokey way to do this, but it should work well enough and it keeps the answers in 1 file)
# For each question state any extra assumptions you made, and explain your answer.
# An incorrect answer with no explanation will get no partial credit.

# Question 1: What is the worst-case big-O runtime of your get_size function?

# LEAVE THESE LINES ALONE BEGIN:
# So the code I provide at the bottom needs these lines of code.

# This code defines valid directions a word can travel.
# Each direction is a tuple (dx, dy) that says how you change x and y
# coordinates to go in a given direction.
RIGHT = (1, 0)       # to go right add 1 to x
DOWN = (0, 1)         # to go down add 1 to y
RIGHT_DOWN = (1, 1)  # to go right_down add 1 to both x and y
RIGHT_UP = (1, -1)    # to go right_up add 1 to x and subtract 1 from y
DIRECTIONS = (RIGHT, DOWN, RIGHT_DOWN, RIGHT_UP)
# Good use of these direction-tuples makes for much easier programs for this project. assignment.

#  PROVIDED CODE -- You shouldn't need to change any of this.
#  (it's not that we didn't think you could write this, it's this stuff is either
#  1) really easy and not worth putting in a 1913 project or
#  2) really, really specific. (it's hard to describe the correct function of
#     these two functions without just telling you exactly how to do it.)
#
#  These are provided to "complete" the project -- I.E. these work with the code you write and allow you to use your
#  functions to generate word-searches for personal use. It is RECOMMENDED that you build a front-end for this behavior
#  so you can more easily use and play-with the finished product.
